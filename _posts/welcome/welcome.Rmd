  Welcome to my blog on a Visual Analytics Journey!    
  
  This blog is part of a course called "Visual Analytics and Application" conducted by Prof Kam Ting Seong in the 
  Singapore Management University (SMU).    
  
  I will be posting various Data Visualisation Makeovers 
  as part of the course deliverables and also be posting on our Data Visualisation Project.    
  
  Feel free to give feedbacks on our work. Thank you!
